        <p>First time here. Burgers were great. Duck fat fries were amazing. Our son had been here, said we had to try it. Definitely will be back. </p>
      <li>2/5 Stars</li>
        <p>4 years ago, I gave this place a 5 star review after a half dozen visits because the food and the service were both excellent. However this trip, was quite different. Dirty tables everywhere, sloppily assembled food, and mediocre execution on the burgers. The staff was friendly enough and accommodating, but it feels like management stopped caring at some point.

          I typically will give places the benefit of the doubt, and understand that Covid has made running a restaurant significantly more challenging. That being said there is a basic standard that I think places need to meet, especially if I’m going to drop $45 on some crappy burgers.  With all of the other great burger options we probably won’t be back.
          
          I hope they get things turned around because we used to really like this place.</p>

          <p>I’ve been wanting to try this place for a while so after I got my pedicure at Vs nails I stopped by this place. The burger was good but the goat cheese was a little bit heavy-handed but I still thought it was it was pretty good burger. I appreciated the peaches on it! I would’ve liked a little more lettuce.  The meat was a little bit overcooked I wish I had gotten it medium rare instead of medium well. The fries are also really well seasoned. The only thing I did not like was the fried onions. I regret getting those. Overall good first experience here</p>
